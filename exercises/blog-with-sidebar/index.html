                    Super Mario 64 is a 1996 platform game developed and 
                    published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. It was released 
                    in Japan and North America in 1996 and PAL regions in 1997.
                    It is the first Super Mario game to feature 3D gameplay, 
                    combining traditional Super Mario gameplay, visual style, 
                    and characters in a large open world. In the game, Bowser, 
                    the primary antagonist of the Super Mario franchise, invades
                    Princess Peach's castle and hides the castle's sources of 
                    protection, the Power Stars, in many different worlds 
                    inside magical paintings. As Mario, the player collects 
                    Power Stars to unlock enough of Princess Peach's castle 
                    to get to Bowser and rescue Princess Peach.

                    Super Mario 64 has been considered one of the greatest video
                    games of all time. Numerous developers have cited it as an 
                    influence on 3D platform games, with its dynamic camera 
                    system and 360-degree analog control establishing a new 
                    archetype for the genre, much as Super Mario Bros. did for 
                    side-scrolling platform games. It was remade as Super 
                    Mario 64 DS for the Nintendo DS in 2004, and has been 
                    ported to other Nintendo consoles since. The game has 
                    attracted a cult following, spawning many fangames and mods,
                    a large speedrunning presence, and enduring rumors 
                    surrounding game features.

                <p>
                    The game begins with a letter from Princess Peach inviting 
                    Mario to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for 
                    him. When he arrives, Mario discovers that Bowser has 
                    invaded the castle and imprisoned the princess and her 
                    servants within its walls using the power of the castle's 
                    120 Power Stars. The Power Stars are hidden in the castle's 
                    paintings, which serve as portals to other worlds where 
                    Bowser's minions keep watch over the Stars. Mario explores 
                    the castle and enters these worlds, gaining access to more 
                    rooms as he recovers more Stars. Mario unlocks two 
                    doors to different floors of the castle with keys obtained 
                    by defeating Bowser in hidden worlds. After getting 
                    at least 70 of the 120 Stars, Mario breaks the curse of the 
                    endless stairs that block the entrance to Bowser's final 
                    hiding place. After Mario defeats Bowser in the final 
                    battle, and Bowser escapes, swearing revenge, he obtains 
                    a special Power Star which gives him the Wing Cap, and he 
                    flies back to the castle's courtyard. Peach is released 
                    from the stained-glass window above the castle's entrance,
                    and she rewards Mario by kissing him on the nose and baking 
                    the cake that she had promised him.
