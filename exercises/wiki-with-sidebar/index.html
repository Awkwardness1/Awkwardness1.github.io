                <p>
                    Undertale is a 2015 2D role-playing video game created by 
                    American indie developer Toby Fox. The player controls a 
                    child named Frisk who has fallen into the Underground: a 
                    large, secluded region under the surface of the Earth, 
                    separated by a magical barrier. The player meets various 
                    monsters during the journey back to the surface, although 
                    some monsters might engage the player in a fight. The 
                    combat system involves the player navigating through mini-
                    bullet hell attacks by the opponent. They can opt to pacify 
                    or subdue monsters in order to spare them instead of killing
                    them. These choices affect the game, with the dialogue, 
                    characters, and story changing based on outcomes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of artwork and character designs by Temmie Chang and
                    other guest designers, Fox developed the entirety of the 
                    game by himself, including the script and music. The game 
                    took inspiration from several sources, including the 
                    Brandish, Mario & Luigi, and Mother role-playing game 
                    series, bullet hell shooter series Touhou Project, 
                    role-playing game Moon: Remix RPG Adventure, and British 
                    comedy show Mr. Bean. Undertale was originally meant to 
                    be two hours in length and was set to be released in 
                    mid-2014, but received delays.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game was released for OS X and Windows in September 
                    2015. It was also ported to Linux in July 2016, PlayStation 
                    4 and PlayStation Vita in August 2017, the Nintendo Switch 
                    in September 2018, and Xbox One in March 2021. The game was 
                    acclaimed for its thematic material, intuitive combat 
                    system, musical score, originality, story, dialogue, and 
                    characters. The game sold over one million copies and was 
                    nominated for multiple accolades and awards. Several 
                    gaming publications and conventions listed Undertale as 
                    game of the year, and others have since listed it as one 
                    of the greatest video games ever made. Two chapters of a 
                    related game, Deltarune, were released in 2018 and 2021.

                <p>
                    Undertale is a role-playing game that uses a top-down 
                    perspective.[3] In the game, the player controls a child
                    and completes objectives in order to progress through
                    the story.[4] Players explore an underground world
                    filled with towns and caves, and are required to solve 
                    numerous puzzles on their journey.[4][5] The underground
                    world is the home of monsters, many of whom challenge the 
                    player in combat;[5] players decide whether to kill, flee,
                    or befriend them.[4][6] Choices made by the player 
                    radically affect the plot and general progression 
                    of the game, with the player's morality acting as the 
                    cornerstone for the game's development.[7] 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When players encounter enemies in either scripted events 
                    or random encounters, they enter a battle mode. During
                    battles, players control a small heart which represents 
                    their soul, and must avoid attacks unleashed by the opposing
                    monster similar to a bullet hell shooter.[4][5] As the game
                    progresses, new elements are introduced, such as colored 
                    obstacles, and boss battles which change the way players 
                    control the heart.[8] Players may choose to attack the 
                    enemy, which involves timed button presses. Killing 
                    enemies will cause the player to earn EXP (in turn 
                    increasing their LOVE) and gold.[9] They can use the ACT 
                    option to check an enemy's attacking and defending 
                    attributes as well as perform various other actions, 
                    which vary depending on the enemy.[4] If the player uses 
                    the right actions to respond to the enemy, or attacks them 
                    until they have low HP (but still alive), they can then 
                    choose to spare them and end the fight without killing 
                    them.[10] For some boss encounters to be completed 
                    peacefully, the player is required to survive until the 
                    character they are facing has finished their dialogue. 
                    The game features multiple story branches and endings 
                    depending on whether players choose to kill or spare 
                    their enemies; and as such, it is possible to clear 
                    the game without killing a single enemy.[11]

                    Undertale is set in the Underground, a realm where monsters
                    were banished after war broke out with humans. The 
                    Underground is sealed from the surface by a magic barrier
                    with a singular gap at Mount Ebott.[15] In the year 201X, 
                    a human child falls into the Underground from Mount Ebott 
                    and encounters Flowey, a sentient flower who teaches the 
                    player the game's mechanics and lies about "LV", or "LOVE",
                    in an attempt to kill them. The human is rescued by 
                    Toriel, a motherly goat-like monster, who teaches them 
                    how to survive conflict in the Underground without 
                    killing. She intends to adopt the human, wanting to
                    protect them from Asgore, the king of the Underground.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The human eventually leaves Toriel to search for Asgore's 
                    castle, which contains the barrier to the surface world. 
                    They encounter several monsters, such as the skeletons Sans 
                    and Papyrus, two brothers who act as sentries for the 
                    Snowdin forest; Undyne, the head of the royal guard; Alphys,
                    the kingdom's royal scientist; and Mettaton, a robotic 
                    television host Alphys created. Most of the monsters are 
                    fought, with the human choosing whether to kill them or 
                    to spare and possibly befriend the monster. During their 
                    travels, the human learns that many years ago, Asriel, the 
                    son of Asgore and Toriel, befriended the first human who 
                    fell into the Underground. When the child abruptly died, 
                    Asriel used the child's soul to pass through the barrier, 
                    intending to return the body to the surface. The humans 
                    living there attacked and killed Asriel, causing Asgore 
                    to declare war. In the present day, Asgore has collected 
                    six souls from fallen humans, of which he needs one more to 
                    destroy the barrier.

                <p>
                    The game's ending depends on how the player handles 
                    encounters with monsters.[16][11][d] If the player completes
                    a playthrough without killing any monsters (or killed some 
                    but not all of the monsters) they experience the "Neutral" 
                    ending. The human arrives at Asgore's castle and is forced 
                    to fight him. Sans stops the human before their 
                    confrontation, revealing that the human's "LOVE" and "EXP" 
                    are acronyms for "level of violence" and "execution points"
                    , respectively.[e] Sans judges the human based on their 
                    accumulated "LOVE" and "EXP". The human then fights Asgore,
                    but Flowey interrupts, killing Asgore and stealing the 
                    human souls. With the help of the souls, the human defeats
                    Flowey and leaves the Underground. They then receive a phone
                    call from Sans, detailing the state of the Underground 
                    after the human's departure, with the specifics depending 
                    on who was killed or spared.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the player kills no monsters before completing a 
                    "Neutral" ending, they can reload their saved game to 
                    complete the "Pacifist" ending.[18][16] Flowey is revealed 
                    to be a reincarnation of Asriel accidentally created by 
                    Alphys's experiments. During the fight with Asgore, Toriel 
                    stops the battle and is joined by the other monsters the 
                    human befriended. Flowey ambushes the group, absorbing the 
                    souls of all the humans and monsters in order to take an 
                    older Asriel's form. During the ensuing fight, the human 
                    manages to connect with the souls of their friends, and 
                    eventually defeats Asriel: He reverts to his child form, 
                    destroys the barrier, and expresses remorse for his actions 
                    before leaving, revealing the human's true name as Frisk. 
                    The human falls unconscious and is awoken to see their 
                    friends surrounding them. The monsters peacefully 
                    reintegrate with the humans, while the human has the option 
                    of accepting Toriel as their adoptive mother.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A third ending, known by fans as the "No Mercy" or 
                    "Genocide" ending, ensues if the player kills every single 
                    monster in the game that can be fought. This involves 
                    continuously triggering random encounters in each area until
                    no more monsters remain. Going down this route changes 
                    many aspects of the game: the game's soundtrack becomes 
                    more ominous, and most other characters are absent from the
                    Overworld, having evacuated to escape the player's rampage. 
                    The few remaining characters that can be interacted with 
                    have changed dialogue, reflecting the impact the player's 
                    actions are having on the game's world.[14][20] When the 
                    human reaches Asgore's castle, Sans attempts to stop them, 
                    but fails and is slain. Flowey kills Asgore in an attempt 
                    to obtain mercy, but is killed by the human. Chara, the 
                    first fallen child who befriended Asriel, then appears and 
                    erases the world. To enable further replays of the game, 
                    the player must give their soul to Chara, restoring the 
                    world and causing a permanent alteration to the Pacifist 
                    ending.[18]

                <hr>
                <p>
                    Undertale was developed by Toby Fox across 32 months.[21] 
                    Development was financed through a crowdfunding campaign on 
                    the website Kickstarter. The campaign was launched on June 
                    25, 2013, with a goal of US$5,000; it ended on July 25, 
                    2013, with US$51,124 raised by 2,398 people.[22] Fox had 
                    little experience with game development; he and his three 
                    brothers often used RPG Maker 2000 to make role-playing 
                    games, though few were ever completed. Fox also worked on 
                    several EarthBound ROM hacks while in high school.[23] 
                    Before the release of Undertale, he was best known for 
                    composing music for the webcomic Homestuck, starting in 
                    2010.[21][24] Undertale was the first full game that he 
                    wrote.[25]
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to Fox, he was casually reading Wikipedia in 
                    December 2012 when he found its article for array data 
                    structures, something Fox didn't have knowledge of. After 
                    reading the page, he thought about how he could use it to 
                    create a text system for an RPG. After completing it, he
                    came up with the idea of creating a battle system.[24] This 
                    system, which was created using the game creation system 
                    GameMaker: Studio,[26] informed how Fox wrote the story, 
                    as both are intertwined.[25] He wanted to develop a role-
                    playing game that was different from the traditional 
                    design, which he often found "boring to play".[23] He set 
                    out to develop a game with "interesting characters", and 
                    that "utilizes the medium as a storytelling device ... 
                    instead of having the story and gameplay abstractions be 
                    completely separate".[23]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fox worked on the entire game independently, besides some 
                    of the art; he decided to work independently to avoid 
                    relying on others.[21] Temmie Chang worked as the main 
                    artist for the game, providing most of the sprites and 
                    concept art.[27][28] Fox has said that the game's art 
                    style would likely remain the same if he had access to a 
                    larger team of artists. He found that "there's a 
                    psychological thread that says audiences become more 
                    attached to characters drawn simply rather than in detail", 
                    particularly benefiting from the use of visual gags within 
                    the art.[29] Retrospectively, Fox described Undertale as "a 
                    huge katamari of things that [he likes] that [he] combined 
                    arbitrarily," adding that part of the story "was almost 
                    written improvisationally at the last minute".[25]

                <h3>Game Design</h3>
                <p>
                    The defensive segment within the battle system was inspired 
                    by the Mario & Luigi series, as well as bullet hell shooters
                    such as the Touhou Project series.[30] When working on the 
                    battle system, Fox set out to create a mechanic that he 
                    would personally enjoy.[31] He wanted Undertale to have a
                    battle system equally engaging as Super Mario RPG (1996)
                    and Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga (2003). Fox did not want 
                    grinding to be necessary at any point in the game, instead 
                    leaving it optional to players. He also did not wish to 
                    introduce fetch quests, as they involve backtracking, which 
                    he dislikes.[21] In terms of the game's difficulty, Fox 
                    ensured that it was easy and enjoyable. He asked some 
                    friends who are inexperienced with bullet hell shooters 
                    to test the game, and found that they were able to complete 
                    it. He felt that the game's difficulty is optimal, 
                    particularly considering the complications involved in 
                    adding another difficulty setting.[32]               
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game's dialogue system was inspired by Shin Megami 
                    Tensei (1992),[30] particularly the gameplay mechanic 
                    whereby players can talk to monsters to avoid conflict. 
                    Fox intended to expand upon this mechanic, as failing to 
                    negotiate resulted in a requirement to fight. "I want to 
                    create a system that satisfied my urge for talking to 
                    monsters," he said.[5] When he began developing this
                    mechanic, the concept of completing the game without 
                    killing any enemies "just evolved naturally".[33] However, 
                    he never considered removing the option to fight throughout
                    development.[33] When questioned on the difficulty of 
                    playing the game without killing, Fox responded that it is
                    "the crux of one of the major themes of this game", 
                    asking players to think about it themselves.[33] Despite 
                    not having played it, Fox was inspired by the concepts of 
                    Moon: Remix RPG Adventure (1997), which involved the player 
                    repairing the damage of the "Hero" and increasing their 
                    "Love Level" by helping people instead of hurting them.[34] 
                    Fox also cited Cave Story (2004) as a general inspiration 
                    for the game.[24]                
                </p>
                <h3>Writing</h3>
                <p>
                    According to Fox, the "idea of being trapped in an 
                    underground world" was inspired by the video game Brandish.
                    [28] Fox was partly influenced by the silliness of internet 
                    culture, as well as comedy shows like Mr. Bean.[21]:
                     1:27:30  He was also inspired by the unsettling atmosphere 
                    of EarthBound.[21] Fox's desire to "subvert concepts that 
                    go unquestioned in many games" further influenced 
                    Undertale's development.[33] Fox found that the writing 
                    became easier after establishing a character's voice and 
                    mood. He also felt that creating the world was a natural 
                    process, as it expressed the stories of those within it.[29]
                    Fox felt the importance to make the game's monsters "feel 
                    like an individual".[30] He cited the Final Fantasy series 
                    as the opposite; "all monsters in RPGs like Final Fantasy 
                    are the same ... there's no meaning to that".[30]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The character of Toriel, who is one of the first to appear 
                    in the game, was created as a parody of tutorial characters.
                    Fox strongly disliked the use of the companion character 
                    Fi in The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword, in which the 
                    answers to puzzles were often revealed early. Fox also felt
                    that role-playing video games generally lack strong 
                    mother characters; in the Pokémon series, as well as Mother 
                    and EarthBound, Fox felt that the mothers are used as 
                    "symbols rather than characters".[23] In response, Fox 
                    intended for Toriel's character to be "a mom that hopefully 
                    acts like a mom", and "genuinely cares" about players' 
                    actions.[23] Initially, Toriel had to be killed in order to 
                    progress the game, but Fox changed it before the release of 
                    Undertale's demo.[25]

                    Papyrus and Sans are named after the typefaces Papyrus and 
                    Comic Sans, and their in-game dialogue is displayed 
                    accordingly in their respective eponymous fonts.[35] Both 
                    characters are listed in the game's credits as being 
                    inspired by J.N. Wiedle, author of Helvetica, a webcomic 
                    series about a skeleton named after the font of the same 
                    name. Papyrus in particular was conceived as a sketch in 
                    Fox's notebook; he was originally a mean spirited character
                    named "Times New Roman" who wears a fedora.[36]
                </p>
                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>
                    The game's soundtrack was entirely composed by Fox with FL 
                    Studio.[39] A self-taught musician, he composed most of the 
                    tracks with little iteration; the game's main theme, 
                    "Undertale", was the only song to undergo multiple 
                    iterations in development. The soundtrack was inspired 
                    by music from Super NES role-playing games,[21] such as 
                    EarthBound,[40] bullet hell series Touhou Project,[41] 
                    as well as the webcomic Homestuck, for which Fox provided 
                    some of the music.[21] Fox also stated that he tries to be 
                    inspired by all music he listens to,[31] particularly 
                    those in video games.[40] According to Fox, over 90% of the 
                    songs were composed specifically for the game.[26] 
                    "Megalovania", the song used during the boss battle with 
                    Sans, had previously been used within Homestuck and in one 
                    of Fox's EarthBound ROM hacks.[38][42] For each section of 
                    the game, Fox composed the music prior to programming, as 
                    it helped "decide how the scene should go".[26] He 
                    initially tried using a music tracker to compose the 
                    soundtrack, but found it difficult to use. He ultimately 
                    decided to play segments of the music separately, and 
                    connect them on a track.[40] To celebrate the first 
                    anniversary of the game, Fox released five unused musical 
                    works on his blog in 2016.[43] Four of the game's songs 
                    were released as official downloadable content for the 
                    Steam version of Taito's Groove Coaster.[42]

                    Undertale's soundtrack has been well received by critics as 
                    part of the success of the game, in particular for its use 
                    of various leitmotifs for the various characters used 
                    throughout various tracks.[44][45] In particular, 
                    "Hopes and Dreams", the boss theme when fighting
                    Asriel in the Pacifist run, brings back most of the main 
                    character themes, and is "a perfect way to cap off your 
                    journey", according to USgamer's Nadia Oxford.[38] Oxford 
                    notes this track in particular demonstrates Fox's ability 
                    at "turning old songs into completely new experiences", 
                    used throughout the game's soundtrack.[38] Tyler Hicks of 
                    GameSpot compared the music to "bit-based melodies".[46]

                    The Undertale soundtrack had frequently been covered by 
                    various styles and groups. As part of the fifth anniversary 
                    of the game, Fox streamed footage with permission of a 2019 
                    concert of the Undertale songs performed by Music Engine, 
                    an orchestra group in Japan, with support of Fangamer and 
                    8-4.[47]

                    Undertale's first demo was released on May 23, 2013,[48] 
                    which at the time was said to account for about 25 percent 
                    of the full game.[49] It had an initial release timeframe 
                    of Summer 2014.[49] The game was released on September 15,
                    2015, for OS X and Windows,[50] and on July 17, 2016, for 
                    Linux.[51] Fox expressed interest in releasing Undertale 
                    on other platforms, but was initially unable to port it 
                    to Nintendo platforms without reprogramming the game due 
                    to the engine's lack of support for these platforms.[21]
                    A patch was released in January 2016, fixing bugs and 
                    altering the appearance of blue attacks to help colorblind 
                    players see them better.[52] Sony Interactive Entertainment 
                    announced during E3 2017 that Undertale would get a release 
                    for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, and a retail 
                    version published by Fangamer. These versions were released 
                    on August 15, 2017.[53][54][55]

                    A Nintendo Switch version was revealed during a March 2018 
                    Nintendo Direct, though no release date was given at the 
                    time;[56][57] Undertale's release on Switch highlighted a 
                    deal made between Nintendo and YoYo Games to allow users 
                    of GameMaker Studio 2 to directly export their games to the 
                    Switch.[58] The Switch version was released on September 
                    15, 2018 in Japan,[59] and on September 18, 2018, worldwide.
                    [60] The Xbox One version was released on March 16, 2021. 
                    As with the PlayStation 4 and Switch versions, the Xbox One 
                    version features unique content specific to that platform.
                    [61] All the console ports were developed and published by

                <p>
                    Other Undertale media and merchandise have been released, 
                    including toy figurines and plush toys based on characters 
                    from the game.[62] The game's official soundtrack, 
                    Undertale Soundtrack, was released by video game music label
                    Materia Collective in 2015, simultaneously with the game's 
                    release.[63] Additionally, two official Undertale cover 
                    albums have been released: the 2015 metal/electronic album 
                    Determination by RichaadEB and Amie Waters,[64][65] and 
                    the 2016 jazz album Live at Grillby's by Carlos Eiene, 
                    better known as insaneintherainmusic.[66] Another album of 
                    jazz duets based on Undertale's songs, Prescription for 
                    Sleep, was performed and released in 2016 by saxophonist 
                    Norihiko Hibino and pianist Ayaki Sato.[67]

                    A 2xLP vinyl edition of the Undertale soundtrack, produced 
                    by iam8bit, was also released in the same year.[68] Two 
                    official UNDERTALE Piano Collections sheet music books and 
                    digital albums, arranged by David Peacock and performed by 
                    Augustine Mayuga Gonzales, were released in 2017 and 2018 
                    by Materia Collective.[69][70] A Mii Fighter costume based 
                    on Sans was made available for download in the crossover 
                    title Super Smash Bros. Ultimate in September 2019, marking
                    the character's official debut as a 3D model. This costume 
                    also adds a new arrangement of "Megalovania" by Fox as a 
                    music track.[71] Super Smash Bros. director Masahiro Sakurai
                    noted that Sans was a popular request to appear in the 
                    game.[72] Music from Undertale was also added to Taiko no 
                    Tatsujin: Drum 'n' Fun! as downloadable content.[73]

                <h3>Japanese localization</h3>
                <p>
                    After Undertale's release, a small Japanese fan community 
                    slowly emerged, leading to an unofficial fan localization 
                    patch being released in early 2016. Since Fox had envisioned
                    a Japanese translation as an eventual goal while working 
                    on the game, he consulted a number of different companies, 
                    eventually choosing 8-4, which had previously translated 
                    Aquaria and Shovel Knight.[74][75]                
                </p>

                    To ensure a consistent voice for the game, 8-4 chose to 
                    employ only one primary translator, Keiko Fuchicho, even 
                    though it would lead to the Japanese version taking longer 
                    to release. She was supported by a small team of editors 
                    and proofreaders, and a programmer which modified the game 
                    to work with Japanese writing systems. Before the 
                    translation began in early 2016, Fox provided development 
                    notes and annotated dialogue to the team, and he continued 
                    to support and advise them throughout its creation.[75] As 
                    PC gaming is less prominent in Japan, they concurrently 
                    made the decision to release Undertale for consoles, with 
                    the porting also being handled by 8-4.[74][76] After the 
                    localization's announcement, many fans were surprised by 
                    the decision to use the Japanese pronoun oira (おいら) for 
                    Sans, leading to the term "oira shock".[77][75] The 
                    localization was released for PS4 and Vita on August 16 
                    2017, and for PC on August 22.[78][79]

                    Undertale received "universal acclaim" from critics, 
                    according to review aggregator website Metacritic.[80][81]
                    [82] There, it is the third-highest rated Windows game 
                    released in 2015,[80] and among the top 50 of all time.[88] 
                    It was temporarily the highest-rated PC game of all time on 
                    Metacritic after release.[89] Praise was particularly 
                    directed at the game's writing, unique characters, and 
                    combat system. GameSpot's Tyler Hicks declared it "one of 
                    the most progressive and innovative RPGs to come in a long 
                    time",[46] and IGN's Kallie Plagge called it "a masterfully 
                    crafted experience".[17]

                    Daniel Tack of Game Informer called the game's combat 
                    system "incredibly nuanced", commenting on the uniqueness 
                    of each enemy encounter.[85] Giant Bomb's Austin Walker 
                    praised the complexity of the combat, commenting that it 
                    is "unconventional, clever, and occasionally really 
                    difficult".[84] Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw of The Escapist 
                    commended the game's ability to blend turn-based and 
                    live combat elements.[90] IGN's Plagge praised the ability 
                    to avoid combat, opting for friendly conversations instead.
                    [17] Jesse Singal of The Boston Globe found the game's 
                    ability to make the player empathize with the monsters 
                    during combat if they opted for non-violent actions was "
                    indicative of the broader, fundamental sweetness at the 
                    core" of Undertale.[91]
