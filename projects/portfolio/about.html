                        Hello! My name is Olivia Persic!
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        I'm a 20-year-old with a ton of passion for Graphic 
                        Design and the Creative arts!
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Art has always been a big part of my life. Communicating
                        Ideas and fundraising has pushed me down the path of 
                        Graphic design! I am currently enrolled at First 
                        Institute to further cultivate my skills. however, 
                        I am already taking strides to turn what I love into
                        my career. I am already confident in my abilities with 
                        Illustrator and Photoshop to create designs, and I am 
                        only growing more comfortable with the rest of the 
                        suite. Let's create something wonderful together!
                    </p>
